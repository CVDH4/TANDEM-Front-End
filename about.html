        <h1>About</h1>

        <p>TANDEM is an environment that generates quantitative image and text data from files submitted by the user. This output is intended to be used as source material for data visualization, quantitative analysis, and distant reading of multimodal print objects.</p>

        <p>TANDEM compiles existing open source technologies including Tesseract OCR, image feature extraction, and light natural language processing packages to generate output. Along with a main .CSV file containing important features, the user is given a downloadable folder full of OCR-ed text, word lists, and more.</p>

        <p>To explore the functionality of TANDEM, our team is employing a test corpus of Public Domain Mother Goose picture books. The test corpus illustrate how TANDEM streamlines the ability to generate the kinds of data needed to make informed distant readings of multimodal print artifacts.</p>

        <p>TANDEM has an intended audience of scholars with a range of computational expertise and a need for quantitative insight into picture books, comics, illuminated manuscripts, and other images with overlaid text. That said, anyone is free to use and explore this tool!</p>
